## Overview
The Project AEP aims to develop a comprehensive TaskAgent system that will revolutionize task management within the organization. The system will provide users with the ability to create, assign, track, and prioritize tasks efficiently, ultimately improving task visibility, enhancing collaboration among team members, and increasing overall productivity.

## Background and Motivation
The need for the TaskAgent system arises from the current inefficiencies in task management processes within the organization. There is a lack of visibility and coordination among team members, leading to missed deadlines and duplicated efforts. By implementing a centralized task management system, the organization aims to address these challenges and streamline task-related activities.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Develop a web-based TaskAgent application with robust task management functionalities.
- Integrate the system with existing project management tools for seamless workflow.
- Improve task visibility, collaboration, and productivity within the organization.
- Provide managers with comprehensive task reports and analytics for performance tracking.

### Non-Goals
- Integration with third-party tools beyond Jira and Slack.
- Advanced automation features beyond the scope of basic task management.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The TaskAgent system will follow a three-tier architecture consisting of a frontend interface built using React, a backend API developed in Node.js, and a MongoDB database for data storage. The system will be hosted on AWS for scalability and reliability.

### Components
1. Task Creation Module: Responsible for allowing users to create new tasks with relevant details.
2. Task Assignment Module: Enables users to assign tasks to specific team members.
3. Task Tracking Module: Tracks the status of tasks and provides real-time updates.
4. Reporting Module: Generates task reports and analytics for managers.

### Data Models / Schemas / Artifacts
The database schema will include collections for tasks, users, and task history. Each task will have fields for title, description, due date, priority, status, and assigned user.

### APIs / Interfaces / Inputs & Outputs
- POST /api/tasks: API for creating new tasks.
- PUT /api/tasks/{task_id}: API for updating task details.
- GET /api/tasks/{user_id}: API for retrieving tasks assigned to a specific user.
- Authentication: JWT-based authentication mechanism for secure access.

### User Interface / User Experience
The user interface will feature a clean and intuitive design with easy navigation. User flows will be optimized for task creation, assignment, tracking, and reporting functionalities.

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk:** Scalability challenges with increasing user load.
  - **Mitigation:** Implementing performance optimization techniques and regular load testing.
- **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches.
  - **Mitigation:** Enforcing strict authentication mechanisms and regular security audits.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit testing for backend APIs using Jest.
- Integration testing for frontend components with React Testing Library.
- End-to-end testing using Cypress for overall system functionality.
- User acceptance testing with a select group of users for feedback.

## Dependencies

- React, Node.js, MongoDB, AWS services.
- Integration with Jira and Slack APIs for seamless workflow.
- External libraries for authentication and data encryption.

## Conclusion

The TaskAgent system design aims to address the organization's task management challenges by providing a robust, user-friendly platform for creating, assigning, tracking, and reporting tasks. By following the outlined architecture and design principles, the system is poised to enhance collaboration, productivity, and overall efficiency within the organization.
