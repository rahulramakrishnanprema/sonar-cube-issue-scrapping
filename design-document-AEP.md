## Overview
The Project AEP aims to develop a comprehensive TaskAgent system that will assist users in managing their tasks efficiently. The system will provide features for task creation, assignment, tracking, and prioritization to enhance organization and productivity for users across multiple devices.

## Background and Motivation
The need for the TaskAgent system arises from the increasing demand for efficient task management tools in various industries. Users face challenges in organizing and tracking tasks effectively, leading to decreased productivity and missed deadlines. The TaskAgent system aims to address these pain points by providing a user-friendly platform for task management.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Develop a web-based TaskAgent application with task creation, assignment, tracking, and prioritization features.
- Enable users to assign tasks to team members, set due dates, and track task status.
- Enhance user productivity and organization through efficient task management.

### Non-Goals
- Advanced automation features beyond basic task management.
- Integration with external project management tools in the initial phase.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The TaskAgent system will follow a client-server architecture with a frontend built using React, a backend powered by Node.js, and data storage in MongoDB. The system will utilize RESTful APIs for communication between components.

### Components
1. Task Creation Component: Responsible for creating tasks with title, description, due date, and priority.
2. Task Assignment Component: Enables users to assign tasks to team members within the system.
3. Task Tracking Component: Allows users to view and update task status and comments.
4. Notification Component: Sends notifications to users for upcoming task deadlines.

### Data Models / Schemas / Artifacts
- Task Schema: Includes fields for title, description, due date, priority, assigned user, and status.
- User Schema: Stores user information such as name, email, and role.
- Task Status Schema: Tracks task completion status and comments.

### APIs / Interfaces / Inputs & Outputs
- POST /api/tasks: Create a new task.
- PUT /api/tasks/{task_id}: Update task details.
- GET /api/tasks/{user_id}: Retrieve tasks assigned to a specific user.
- POST /api/notifications: Send notifications for upcoming task deadlines.

### User Interface / User Experience
The user interface will feature a clean and intuitive design with easy navigation. Users will have access to a dashboard displaying their assigned tasks, task status, and upcoming deadlines. The UI will prioritize usability and accessibility for a seamless user experience.

## Risks and Mitigations

Identified Risks:
- Data Security: Mitigated by implementing encryption for user data and secure storage practices.
- Scalability Challenges: Addressed through cloud hosting for flexible scaling options.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will include:
- Unit testing for backend APIs using Jest.
- Integration testing for component interactions.
- User acceptance testing to validate user workflows and features.

## Dependencies

- Node.js for backend development.
- React for frontend development.
- MongoDB for data storage.
- Email services for notifications integration.

## Conclusion

The TaskAgent system design aims to provide a robust and user-friendly platform for efficient task management. By addressing key requirements and implementing a comprehensive design, the system is poised to enhance user productivity and organization effectively. The next steps involve development, testing, and deployment to bring the TaskAgent system to production readiness.
