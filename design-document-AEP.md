## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system architecture will consist of microservices deployed on a cloud-based infrastructure. The platform will utilize a combination of serverless computing and containerization for optimal performance and scalability. Integration with AI services and external APIs will be a key component of the architecture.

### Components
- User Interface Module: Responsible for presenting the platform interface to users.
- AI Generation Module: Utilizes AI algorithms to generate content and insights.
- Research Agent Module: Implements deep research capabilities using OpenSWE Multi-Agent Architecture.
- Database Module: Stores and retrieves user data, generated content, and research results.

### Data Models / Schemas / Artifacts
The database schema will include tables for user profiles, generated content, research data, and system logs. Data models will be designed to optimize query performance and ensure data integrity.

### APIs / Interfaces / Inputs & Outputs
API endpoints will be defined for user authentication, content generation, research queries, and system monitoring. Input data will include user requests, content parameters, research queries, and system configurations. Output data will consist of generated content, research results, user profiles, and system logs.

### User Interface / User Experience
The user interface will feature a modern design with intuitive navigation, interactive elements, and responsive layouts. User experience goals include seamless task completion, clear information presentation, and personalized content recommendations.
