# Project Title: Project AEP
## Authors
- John Doe

## Overview
The Project AEP aims to implement a comprehensive system for managing user data, authentication, access control, and user interfaces. The project focuses on enhancing security, user experience, and system performance.

## Background and Motivation
The need for Project AEP arises from the requirement to securely store and manage user data, provide role-based access control, and offer a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system. By addressing these needs, the project aims to improve overall system efficiency and user satisfaction.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Implement a robust database schema for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Develop authentication APIs to ensure secure user logins and registrations.
- Establish role-based access control to manage user permissions effectively.
- Create user profile APIs for accessing basic user information.
- Design a user dashboard UI for users to view their profile details.
- Set up DevOps practices for environment setup and infrastructure management.
- Merge files effectively to streamline data processing.
- Implement a Deep Research Agent using OpenSWE Multi-Agent Architecture for advanced AI capabilities.

### Non-Goals
- Implementing complex AI models beyond the scope of the current project.
- Extensive UI/UX redesign beyond basic user dashboard requirements.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system architecture will consist of backend services for data management, authentication, and access control. The frontend will include user interfaces for interacting with the system. The database will store user data and access control information.

### Components
- Database Schema: Define tables for user, skills, training data.
- Authentication APIs: Implement login and registration endpoints.
- Role-Based Access Control: Store roles in the database and enforce permissions.
- User Profile API: Create endpoints for retrieving user profile data.
- User Dashboard UI: Design a simple dashboard to display user information.
- DevOps Setup: Establish infrastructure as code practices for environment setup.
- File Merge: Develop a file merging mechanism for data processing.
- Deep Research Agent: Implement an agent using OpenSWE Multi-Agent Architecture.

### Data Models / Schemas / Artifacts
The database schema will include tables for users, skills, training data, roles, and permissions. Diagrams will be provided to illustrate the relationships between these entities.

### APIs / Interfaces / Inputs & Outputs
API specifications will include endpoint details, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and data validation requirements. Input/output data formats will be documented for each API.

### User Interface / User Experience
The user interface will feature a clean and intuitive design for the user dashboard. User flows will be defined for login, profile viewing, and dashboard navigation.

## Risks and Mitigations

Identified risks include data security vulnerabilities, scalability challenges, and potential integration issues. Mitigations will involve implementing encryption for sensitive data, performance testing for scalability, and thorough integration testing.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will encompass unit testing for backend services, integration testing for API interactions, and user acceptance testing for the user interface. Security testing, performance testing, and scalability testing will also be conducted to ensure system reliability.

## Dependencies

Dependencies for the project include technologies such as Java Spring Boot, React, and OpenSWE Multi-Agent Architecture. Integration with external services for authentication, file management, and DevOps tools will also be essential.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Project AEP aims to deliver a robust system for user data management, authentication, access control, and user interface interaction. By following the outlined design specifications and addressing potential risks, the project is poised for successful implementation and deployment.
