## **Part 1: Complete Requirements Document**

# Requirements Document for Project TASKAGENT

## 1. Executive Summary

The TASKAGENT project aims to develop an advanced, AI-powered task management and automation platform. It is designed to streamline project workflows by intelligently parsing project requirements (from sources like Jira), generating comprehensive technical documentation (requirements, architecture, code), and facilitating automated task execution. The system will leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand context, make decisions, and produce high-quality technical outputs, thereby significantly reducing manual effort in the software development lifecycle and improving project consistency and velocity.

## 2. Project Scope

**In-Scope:**
*   Development of a core AI Agent engine capable of processing and understanding natural language project requirements.
*   Functionality to connect to and fetch data from Jira APIs using a project key.
*   Automated generation of structured requirements documents (like this one) from issue tracking data.
*   Automated generation of technical design documents based on analyzed requirements.
*   A user interface (CLI and/or Web) for users to interact with the agent, input prompts, and view/download generated artifacts.
*   Secure management of API keys and sensitive project data.
*   Implementation of a context management system to maintain conversation history and project state.
*   Capability to generate code snippets, boilerplate, and potentially full module implementations based on requirements and designs.
*   Basic validation and testing of generated outputs (e.g., checking for required sections in documents, basic code syntax checks).

**Out-of-Scope:**
*   Full-stack application development beyond the core agent functionality and its UI.
*   Direct integration with version control systems (e.g., auto-committing code) or CI/CD pipelines in the initial phase.
*   Replacement of human developers; the agent is an assistant and accelerator.
*   Project management functionalities beyond requirement analysis (e.g., resource allocation, time tracking).
*   Advanced, independent code testing and deployment.

**FR3: Design Document Prompt Generation**
*   **FR3.1:** Based on the analyzed requirements, the system shall formulate a detailed, technical prompt.
*   **FR3.2:** This prompt shall be structured to instruct an LLM to generate a Technical Design Document (TDD).

*   **FR5.2:** The system shall be able to create basic boilerplate code for projects (e.g., `package.json`, `__init__.py`, basic class structures).

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance (NF1):** The system should generate a requirements document for a project with {total_issues} issues within 5 minutes.
*   **Security (NF2):** All API keys and tokens must be stored securely using encryption and never logged. Communication with Jira and AI APIs must be over HTTPS.

*   **Reliability (NF4):** The system should handle API failures (Jira, AI provider) gracefully with informative error messages and retry logic where appropriate.
*   **Maintainability (NF5):** The codebase should be well-structured, modular, and documented to allow for easy addition of new features (e.g., GitLab integration, new document templates).

## 5. User Requirements

**User Personas:**
*   **Product Owner / Business Analyst (Alex):** Needs to quickly convert stakeholder conversations and ideas into structured requirements and technical specs. Values speed, accuracy, and completeness.
*   **Software Architect (Bailey):** Needs to create robust system designs based on requirements. Values detailed technical prompts and comprehensive design documents.
*   **Development Team Lead (Casey):** Needs to accelerate project kick-offs and ensure all team members have a clear understanding of requirements. Values clarity and the ability to generate initial code boilerplate.
*   **Developer (Drew):** Needs to understand specific tasks and generate efficient code for well-defined problems. Values accurate code generation and snippets.

**User Stories:**
*   **US1:** As a Product Owner, I want to input a Jira project key so that I can generate a complete requirements document without manual effort.
*   **US2:** As a Software Architect, I want the system to produce a detailed technical design prompt so that I can get a high-quality starting point for my architecture diagram.
*   **US3:** As a Developer, I want the agent to generate a Python function for a specific algorithm described in a Jira ticket so that I can integrate it quickly and reduce boilerplate coding.

## 6. System Requirements

*   **Software:** Python 3.9+, Node.js (if a web UI is built), Docker.
*   **Libraries:** `requests` or `aiohttp` for API calls, `python-jira` library, `langchain` framework for AI agent capabilities, `markdown` for document generation.

*   **Storage:** Local cache for project data and context, or a lightweight database (SQLite).
*   **Infrastructure:** Capability to run as a local script or be deployed in a containerized environment (e.g., Docker).

## 7. Business Rules

*   **BR1:** A project key must be in the format of uppercase letters (e.g., TASK, PROJ).
*   **BR2:** Only issues of type `Story`, `Bug`, `Task`, and `Epic` should be considered for requirements analysis. Sub-tasks may be included under their parent.
*   **BR3:** The priority of a requirement inferred from a Jira issue should be influenced by the issue's priority field and its type (e.g., a Bug might imply a high-priority NFR).
*   **BR4:** Generated documents must adhere to a company-standard template.

    *   **4.3. Data Models:** Define key Python Pydantic/DataClasses or TypeScript interfaces for core data structures (e.g., `JiraIssue`, `ProjectContext`, `AnalysisResult`).

**5. API Specifications**
    *   Design a RESTful API for the core agent service if it is to be deployed as a microservice.
    *   Include endpoints like `POST /api/analyze-project`, `GET /api/projects/{project_id}/documents`.
    *   Detail the request/response payloads, HTTP methods, and status codes for each endpoint.
