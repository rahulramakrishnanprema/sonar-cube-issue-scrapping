## Overview
The Project AEP aims to develop a TaskAgent system that will revolutionize task management for users. By providing a comprehensive platform for creating, assigning, tracking, and prioritizing tasks, the system seeks to enhance task organization, improve collaboration among team members, and boost overall productivity.

## Background and Motivation
In today's fast-paced work environment, efficient task management is crucial for success. The TaskAgent system is needed to address the challenges of scattered task lists, lack of visibility into task progress, and difficulties in prioritizing work. By streamlining task management processes, the system will empower users to stay organized, meet deadlines, and achieve their goals effectively.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Develop a web-based TaskAgent application with robust task management functionalities.
- Enable users to create tasks with detailed information, assign tasks to team members, and track task status.
- Provide notifications for upcoming task deadlines and overdue tasks to ensure timely completion.
- Enhance user productivity by offering intuitive task filtering, sorting, and completion features.

### Non-Goals
- Advanced project management features beyond basic task management.
- Integration with complex third-party tools or services in the initial phase.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The TaskAgent system will follow a three-tier architecture, comprising a frontend built with React, a backend powered by Node.js, and a MongoDB database for data storage. The frontend will interact with the backend through RESTful APIs to manage task-related operations.

### Components
1. Task Creation Component: Responsible for allowing users to create new tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
2. Task Assignment Component: Enables users to assign tasks to themselves or other team members.
3. Task Tracking Component: Tracks task status, completion percentage, and overdue status.
4. Task Filtering Component: Allows users to filter and sort tasks based on various criteria.
5. Notification Component: Sends notifications for upcoming task deadlines and overdue tasks.

### Data Models / Schemas / Artifacts
The database schema will include collections for tasks, users, and task dependencies. Each task document will store details such as title, description, due date, priority, assignee, and completion status. User documents will contain user information for authentication and authorization purposes.

### APIs / Interfaces / Inputs & Outputs
- Task Creation API: POST /api/tasks
- Task Assignment API: PUT /api/tasks/:taskId/assign
- Task Tracking API: GET /api/tasks/:taskId/status
- Notification API: POST /api/notifications

### User Interface / User Experience
The user interface will feature a clean and intuitive design for seamless task management. Users will have access to a dashboard displaying their tasks, with options to create new tasks, assign tasks, mark tasks as complete, and view task details.

## Risks and Mitigations

Identified Risks:
- Technical Risks: Potential scalability issues with a large number of tasks and users.
- Operational Risks: User adoption challenges due to unfamiliarity with the new system.

Mitigation Strategies:
- Technical Risk Mitigation: Implement performance optimizations and scalability measures.
- Operational Risk Mitigation: Conduct user training sessions and provide user-friendly documentation.

## Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will encompass:
- Unit testing for backend APIs using Jest and Supertest.
- Integration testing to validate interactions between frontend and backend components.
- User acceptance testing to ensure the system meets user requirements and expectations.

## Dependencies

- React for frontend development
- Node.js for backend development
- MongoDB for data storage
- Email services for notification integration

## Conclusion

The TaskAgent system design aims to address the challenges of task management by providing a user-friendly platform with essential features for creating, assigning, tracking, and completing tasks. By following the outlined design principles and specifications, the system is poised to deliver a seamless and efficient task management experience for users.
