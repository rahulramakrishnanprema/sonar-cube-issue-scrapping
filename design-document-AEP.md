# Project Title: Project AEP
## Authors
- John Doe

## Overview
The Project AEP aims to develop a comprehensive TaskAgent system that will revolutionize task management for users. By providing a platform for creating, assigning, tracking, and prioritizing tasks efficiently, the system will enhance task visibility, collaboration, and productivity for all users.

## Background and Motivation
In today's fast-paced work environments, effective task management is crucial for success. The TaskAgent system is needed to address the challenges faced by users in managing tasks, ensuring that deadlines are met, and priorities are clear. By streamlining the task management process, the system will improve overall efficiency and effectiveness in task execution.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Develop a web-based task management system with intuitive features for task creation, assignment, status tracking, and priority setting.
- Enhance user collaboration and communication through notifications and task visibility.
- Improve productivity by providing a user-friendly interface for managing tasks efficiently.

### Non-Goals
- Advanced project management functionalities like Gantt charts and resource allocation are out of scope for this project.
- Custom integrations with external tools or services beyond basic email notifications are deferred to future iterations.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The TaskAgent system will follow a client-server architecture with a React frontend, Node.js backend, and MongoDB database. The frontend will interact with the backend through RESTful APIs, enabling seamless communication and data exchange.

### Components
1. Task Creation Module: Responsible for allowing users to create tasks with titles, descriptions, due dates, and priority levels.
2. Task Assignment Module: Enables users to assign tasks to specific individuals or teams.
3. Task Tracking Module: Tracks the status of tasks (e.g., open, in progress, completed) and provides real-time updates.
4. Notification Module: Sends notifications to users for task assignments, updates, and deadlines.

### Data Models / Schemas / Artifacts
- Task Schema: Includes fields for title, description, due date, priority, status, assigned user, etc.
- User Schema: Stores user information such as name, email, role, etc.
- Activity Log: Records all user actions and system events for auditing purposes.

### APIs / Interfaces / Inputs & Outputs
- Task Creation API: POST /api/tasks
- Task Assignment API: PUT /api/tasks/{task_id}/assign
- Task Status Update API: PATCH /api/tasks/{task_id}/status
- User Profile API: GET /api/users/{user_id}

### User Interface / User Experience
The user interface will feature a clean and intuitive design, allowing users to easily create, assign, and track tasks. User-friendly dashboards will provide a quick overview of task statuses and priorities, enhancing the overall user experience.

## Risks and Mitigations

Identified Risks:
- Data Security: Mitigated by implementing encryption mechanisms and access control measures.
- Performance Scalability: Mitigated by optimizing database queries and utilizing cloud hosting for scalability.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit Tests: Test individual components and modules for functionality.
- Integration Tests: Validate interactions between frontend and backend systems.
- User Acceptance Testing: Engage users to ensure the system meets their requirements and expectations.

## Dependencies

- React: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- Node.js: Backend runtime environment for handling server-side logic.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing task and user data.
- Cloud Platform: Hosting environment for deploying the system for scalability.

## Conclusion

The TaskAgent system design aims to address the key requirements outlined in the project issues, providing a robust and user-friendly solution for efficient task management. By following the detailed design specifications, the system is poised to deliver on its objectives and enhance productivity for all users.
