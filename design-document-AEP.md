## Overview
The Project AEP aims to implement an Advanced Enhancement Platform that leverages cutting-edge technologies to streamline task management, improve user experience, and ensure data security. This project will enhance the existing TaskAgent system by adding new features and optimizing performance.

## Background and Motivation
In today's fast-paced work environment, efficient task management is crucial for productivity and success. The need for a comprehensive platform that enables seamless task assignment, tracking, and prioritization has become increasingly evident. Project AEP addresses this need by providing a robust solution that caters to the evolving demands of modern businesses.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Implement task prioritization, assignment, and tracking features.
- Enhance the user interface for improved usability.
- Ensure data security and privacy.
- Optimize system performance for scalability.

### Non-Goals
- Major architectural changes.
- Integration with external systems in this phase.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system architecture of Project AEP will consist of multiple layers including the frontend, backend API, and database. The technology stack will include Node.js for backend development, React for frontend development, and MongoDB for data storage. Integration will be achieved through RESTful APIs.

### Components
1. Task Management Component: Responsible for creating, assigning, and tracking tasks.
2. User Interface Component: Handles the presentation layer for users to interact with the system.
3. Security Component: Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure data security.
4. Performance Optimization Component: Focuses on enhancing system performance for scalability.

### Data Models / Schemas / Artifacts
- Database Schema: Includes tables for tasks, users, roles, and task status.
- Data Structures: Define the structure of task objects, user profiles, and authentication tokens.

### APIs / Interfaces / Inputs & Outputs
- RESTful APIs: Define endpoints for creating tasks, assigning tasks, and updating task status.
- Authentication Interface: Implement JWT-based authentication for secure user access.
- Input/Output Formats: Specify the format of data payloads exchanged between components.

### User Interface / User Experience
The user interface design will prioritize simplicity and intuitiveness. User flows will be optimized for task creation, assignment, and status tracking. Accessibility goals will be met to ensure a seamless user experience across devices.
