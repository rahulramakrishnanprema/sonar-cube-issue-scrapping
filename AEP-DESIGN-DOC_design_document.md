## Background and Motivation
The current landscape lacks a unified solution for {summary}, leading to inefficiencies, data silos, and increased operational overhead. Business drivers include the need for improved data-driven decision-making, enhanced user productivity, and reduced manual intervention. Industry trends toward cloud-native, microservices-based architectures and API-first design inform our technical approach. Key pain points such as {mention specific pain points from requirements} necessitate a robust, future-proof system that can adapt to evolving business needs and technological advancements.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals
- Deliver a fully functional {project_name} that meets all specified requirements in {requirements_specification}.

- Implement robust security measures including encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit logging.
- Provide a seamless user experience with an intuitive interface and responsive design.
- Ensure the system is scalable to handle a 50% increase in user load and data volume without degradation.
- Establish comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting capabilities for operational excellence.

### Non-Goals
- Mobile application development is out of scope for the initial release.
- Integration with legacy systems not explicitly mentioned in requirements.
- Advanced analytics and machine learning capabilities beyond basic reporting.
- Customization or white-labeling features for external clients.
- Real-time collaboration features or multi-tenant architecture support.

## Detailed Design

### System Architecture
The system will follow a cloud-native, microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes. The frontend will be a single-page application (SPA) built with a modern JavaScript framework, communicating with backend services through a API Gateway. Backend services will be implemented as discrete microservices, each responsible for a specific business domain. Data persistence will utilize both relational and NoSQL databases based on specific use cases. The entire system will be deployed on a major cloud provider (AWS/Azure/GCP) with infrastructure-as-code using Terraform.

### Components

**API Gateway**
- Serves as the single entry point for all client requests
- Handles authentication, rate limiting, request routing, and response aggregation
- Implemented using Kong API Gateway with custom plugins for security headers

**User Management Service**
- Responsible for user authentication, authorization, and profile management
- Implements OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect protocols
- Maintains user roles, permissions, and session management
- Integrates with enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0

**Core Business Service**
- Handles primary business logic and workflows
- Processes business transactions and validations
- Maintains domain-specific data and business rules
- Exposes RESTful APIs with versioning support

**Data Processing Service**
- Manages batch and real-time data processing
- Implements ETL pipelines for data transformation
- Handles file uploads, parsing, and validation
- Integrates with message queues for asynchronous processing

**Reporting Service**
- Generates business reports and analytics
- Provides data aggregation and visualization capabilities
- Supports scheduled report generation and export functionality
- Caches frequently accessed reports for performance

**Notification Service**
- Manages all outbound communications
- Supports multiple channels (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Implements template management and delivery tracking
- Provides delivery status webhooks for external systems

### Data Models

**User Schema**
- userId: UUID (primary key)
- username: string (unique)
- email: string (unique, validated)
- passwordHash: string (bcrypt)
- roles: array[string]
- createdAt: timestamp
- updatedAt: timestamp
- lastLoginAt: timestamp

**Business Entity Schema**
- entityId: UUID (primary key)
- name: string (indexed)
- status: enum [ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING]
- metadata: JSONB
- createdBy: UUID (foreign key to User)
- createdAt: timestamp
- updatedAt: timestamp
- version: integer (optimistic locking)

**Transaction Schema**
- transactionId: UUID (primary key)
- type: enum [CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE]
- entityType: string
- entityId: UUID
- previousState: JSONB
- newState: JSONB
- performedBy: UUID (foreign key to User)
- performedAt: timestamp
- ipAddress: string

### APIs

**Authentication Endpoints**
- POST /auth/login - User authentication with credentials
- POST /auth/refresh - Refresh access token
- POST /auth/logout - Invalidate session
- GET /auth/profile - Get current user information

**Business Entity Endpoints**
- GET /api/v1/entities - List entities with filtering and pagination
- POST /api/v1/entities - Create new entity
- GET /api/v1/entities/{id} - Get entity by ID
- PUT /api/v1/entities/{id} - Update entity
- DELETE /api/v1/entities/{id} - Delete entity

**Report Endpoints**
- GET /api/v1/reports - List available reports
- POST /api/v1/reports/generate - Generate report with parameters
- GET /api/v1/reports/{id} - Get report status and results
- DELETE /api/v1/reports/{id} - Cancel report generation

All APIs will follow RESTful conventions, use JSON for request/response payloads, implement proper HTTP status codes, and include comprehensive error handling with structured error responses. API versioning will be implemented through URL path versioning (e.g., /api/v1/). Rate limiting will be enforced per user and per IP address.

### User Interface
The user interface will follow a component-based architecture using a modern JavaScript framework. The design will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and implement responsive design principles for optimal viewing on various devices. Key user flows include:

**Authentication Flow**
- Login/Logout functionality
- Password reset workflow
- Multi-factor authentication setup

**Dashboard Flow**
- Overview of key metrics and recent activity
